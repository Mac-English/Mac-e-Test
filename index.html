    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Harmony -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application uses a three-view, single-page architecture: Welcome, Test, and Results. This structure was chosen to create a clear, task-oriented user flow. It guides the user from understanding the test format (Welcome), to experiencing a simulated exam (Test), and finally to analyzing their performance (Results). This multi-stage approach is more intuitive and effective for a learning tool than a static display of questions, as it separates the distinct tasks of preparation, practice, and review into focused, interactive screens. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: Overall test score. -> Goal: Inform proportion. -> Viz: Donut Chart (Chart.js/Canvas). -> Interaction: Static view of correct vs. incorrect. -> Justification: Provides a quick, easily digestible visual summary of overall performance. Report Info: Sectional scores (Math, English, etc.). -> Goal: Compare performance across categories. -> Viz: Bar Chart (Chart.js/Canvas). -> Interaction: Static view comparing scores. -> Justification: Allows users to instantly identify strong and weak subject areas. Report Info: All test questions. -> Goal: Organize and review. -> Presentation: Interactive HTML list. -> Interaction: Scroll to review each question, its options, the user's answer, and the correct answer. -> Justification: Enables detailed drill-down analysis to understand specific mistakes. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
